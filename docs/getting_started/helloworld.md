# Hello, World!

Every workflow begins with a YAML-based "Workflow Definition". In this article you'll learn the first basics of the workflow definition.

## Demo

```yaml
id: helloworld
states:
- id: hello
  type: noop
  transform: 'jq({ msg: "Hello, world!" })'
```

Run this workflow. Leave the Workflow Input empty for now. You should see something like the following:

### Output:

```json
{
  "msg": "Hello, world!"
}
```

## Workflow Definition

Now that we've seen it in action, let's go through each of the lines in the Workflow Definition and understand what they mean.

### Workflow ID

```yaml
id: helloworld
```

Every workflow definition needs to specify a workflow identifier at the top of the document. The identifier is used by UIs and other workflows as a reference to this workflow. This identifier must be unique within the namespace (more on namespaces later).

### States

```yaml
states:
```

A workflow just wouldn't be a workflow without states to actually do something. Every workflow must have at least one state. 

### State ID

```yaml
- id: hello
```

Like the workflow itself, every state has to have its own identifier. The state identifier is used in logging and to define transitions, which will come up in a later example when we define more than one state. A state identifier must be unique within the workflow definition. 

### State Type

```yaml
  type: noop
```

There are many types of state that do all sorts of different things. We'll go over the possible states later, but for this example we're using the `noop` state. The `noop` state (short for "no-operation") does nothing other than log Instance Data. 

### Transform Command

```yaml
  transform: 'jq({ msg: "Hello, world!" })'
```

Any state may optionally define a "transform", and it's used here to generate the classic "Hello, World!" message. Transform applies a `jq` command to the instance data and replaces the instance data with the results. We'll go into more detail about transforms later.
